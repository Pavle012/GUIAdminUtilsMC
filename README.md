# Admin Utils GUI Datapack

Admin Utils GUI is a Minecraft datapack that adds powerful, easy-to-use graphical interfaces for server administrators.
All menus are built using Minecraft dialogs, meaning no chat spam, no commands to remember — just clean GUIs.

> IMPORTANT
> 
> Requires Minecraft 1.21.6 or newer (dialogs are not available in older versions).
